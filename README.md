## Introduction

The MIPS-32 Pipeline Simulator is a software tool designed to simulate the execution of the MIPS 32bits with a five-stage pipeline architecture. The simulator provides a detailed, cycle-accurate and intuitive visualization of instruction execution, including the contents of the inter-stage registers, the instruction and data memories, the register files and all the significant control flags such as the `AluOP` or branching flags. 

The simulator supports a set of assmebly instructions as input, that are automatically validated for errors and translated to machine code that the simulator architecture can to execute.
